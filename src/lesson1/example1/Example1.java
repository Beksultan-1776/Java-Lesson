/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
    Comments are there to inform others and yourself (in the future, if you forget what the code you wrote does) about
    what is written in that code, etc. The main thing is not to write comments often where it is not necessary, but for
    now it is acceptable for educational purposes.
